# Data-Science-Projects
**This Repository contains various Data Science projects, I have worked upon.**
### 1. Breast Cancer Prediction Model
  + This Model is trained using the sklearn breast cancer dataset and has been tested on [Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elbaronahmedashraf/breast-cancer-classification-with-98-24-acc).
  + Accuracy of this model on our test data was over 98%.
  + Accuracy of this model on Kaggle's Breast Cancer Dataset was also over 98%.
### 2. Iris Clustering Model
  + This Model use the [Kaggle Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset).
  + It includes various clustering plots. 
  + For each plot, I have considered 2 features at a time from Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
  + In conclusion, the result suggested that considering Petal Length and Petal Width as features for plotting, provides the best result for clustering.
